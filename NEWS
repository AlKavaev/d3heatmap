----------------------------------------

###NEW FUNCTIONS:
   * dendToTree - internal function for create a parseable tree from a dendrogram (intended to replace hclustToTree)
   
###UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * d3heatmap - now uses dendToTree instead of hclustToTree (it, of course, doesn't work - since other pieces of the code still needs to be fixed)
